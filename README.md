A 2D shooting game built with C and igraphics library


## Description

A classic space 2D shooting game using C and igraphics library. The game is divided into 3 stages.
As the player pass through the stages the gameplay become harder and need to tackle new type enemies.
It was fun for me developing the game since it was my first game i ever developed.

## Things I learned

I learned how to create scene in **C** using igraphics **library**. I had to solve a few **geometry** problems like
**detect objects collusion ** , **object movement** ( i used trigonometric functions to create complex movement for the objects for
example sine function create sine wave movements).
